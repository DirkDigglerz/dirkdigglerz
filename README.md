# 💫 About Me:
I am the founder of DirkScripts, a leading provider of custom scripts for the Grand Theft Auto Roleplay Platform, FiveM. Over the past 5-6 years, I've transformed my passion for gaming into a successful venture, achieving over 5,000 sales and building a thriving community of satisfied customers. Starting with no coding experience, I began by learning Lua and gradually expanded my expertise to include TypeScript, React, and other modern technologies. This journey has not only enhanced my technical skills but also deepened my understanding of the gaming community's needs. ([dirkscripts.com](https://www.dirkscripts.com/?utm_source=chatgpt.com))
